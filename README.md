After getting the project run "npm install" in your project terminal to install all the dependencies listed in package.json file.

Command will create node_modules folder where all the modules will be installed.

Next step will be running "npm start" for starting a developer server or "npm run build" which will create "dist" folder with all the html, css and js files as well as all the assets.

Developer server is live reload enabled which is helpful if you want to play with a code for a bit.

All files in "dist" folder will be hashed and minimized to improve apps performance for further production purposes.
